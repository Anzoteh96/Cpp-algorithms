# CodeForces

This subrepository the solutions I wrote for CodeForces contests, both live and virtual. More information of my contest history can be found at http://codeforces.com/contests/with/onthefloor. 

## Round 486 (Division 3)

This is my second rated CodeForces contest, in which I solved 4 problems and ranked 250/~2800. This pushed me a +90 rating. 

## Educational Codeforces Round 45

I solved the first four problems, and promoted to the Expert (Blue, rating 1600-1899) category. I also upsolved Problem E after the contest. 

## Round 491 (Division 2)

Got the first 5 problems (+69). 

## Round Educational Codeforces Round 46

Got four problems as in the usual Educationals, and rose to the higher end of the Expert category. 

## Round493 (Division 2)

This is the first contest I screwed up (rather severely) after four consecutive increase in ratings, which I got 2 problems correctly in the contest (problem C failed System Tests no thanks to an edge case) and resulted in a -93 change in rating. I had both C and D upsolved after the contest, nevertheless. 

## Educational Codeforces Round 48

Got four problems as in the usual Educationals, and rose to the higher end (again!) of the Expert category. 

## Round 503 (Division 2)

An extreme fortune where I was ranked 35/4750 (first top 100, or top 50 on Codeforces!) after nailing the first four problems. Pushed to the Candidate Master (Purple, 1900-2099) category. (Oh how cool is it to be able to edit tags for problems!)
